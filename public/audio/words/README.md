# Custom Audio Recordings

Place your recorded audio files in this folder to use your own voice for sight words.

## File Naming

Each audio file should be named after the word in **lowercase** with `.mp3` extension:

```
the.mp3
of.mp3
and.mp3
a.mp3
to.mp3
in.mp3
is.mp3
you.mp3
... etc
```

## Recording Tips

1. **Format**: MP3 is recommended (also supports WAV, OGG)
2. **Speak clearly** at a natural pace
3. **Keep recordings short** - just the word itself
4. **Consistent volume** across all recordings
5. **Minimize background noise**

## Full Word List

Here are all 50 sight words that can have custom audio:

```
the, of, and, a, to, in, is, you, that, it,
he, was, for, on, are, as, with, his, they, I,
at, be, this, have, from, or, one, had, by, words,
but, not, what, all, were, we, when, your, can, said,
there, use, an, each, which, she, do, how, their, if
```

## Fallback

If an audio file is missing, the app will automatically use text-to-speech (TTS) as a fallback.
